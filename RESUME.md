## Project Context

**Water meter telemetry and monitoring solution** for Mosaic Group's block of flats in Durban CBD.

### Business Relationship
- **Precision Meters** (Bradley Cassani, Garth Le Roux) referred Jason to Mosaic Group
- **Condition:** Must use Precision Meters' smart water meters
- Jason provides: telemetry, monitoring platform, integration services

### Site: 477 Anton Lembede Street, Durban
- Block of flats with ~500 units
- Requires 11 bulk meters (50mm) for leak detection
- Requires 500 unit meters (15mm) for individual flat metering
- Phased rollout planned

### Reference Project
**Fairfield Water** (`/home/jason/Projects/fairfield-water`)
- Same approach: smart meters + IoT + web dashboard
- Phase 1 deployed, Phase 2 in progress
- Production: https://fairfield.meter-tracker.com

## Notes

- Precision Meters has no KZN presence (Cape Town based)
- Jason positioned as N3 corridor contact for field support
- 500 meters is a significant project - phased approach wise
- Leak detection (bulk meters) likely higher priority
- Demo platform shared: https://meter-tracker.com
- **Tanya has NOT registered on demo platform yet** - demo in person tomorrow
