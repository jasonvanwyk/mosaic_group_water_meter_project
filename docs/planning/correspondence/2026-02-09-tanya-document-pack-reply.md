Dear Jason,

Thank goodness I was seated :)

Thank you for the documents.

If we did a pilot project how would the software side of things work, I mean this is being customised to a degree and we would need that fully functional to fully evaluate this proposal.

I see that the price excludes the motorised ball values which is important in the scope of the project, what would that cost.

Kind Regards,

Tanya

## Analysis

### Tone
Positive — "Thank goodness I was seated" suggests the business case numbers made an impression. She's asking clarifying questions, not pushing back. She's engaged and thinking practically about next steps.

### Questions Raised

**1. Software for the pilot — how would it work?**
- Tanya wants to understand: will the pilot have a fully functional platform, or a stripped-down prototype?
- She's concerned that a "customised" solution might not be evaluable in pilot form
- Implication: she needs to see a working system to take to the board for full rollout approval

**2. Motorised ball valve pricing**
- The business case explicitly excluded valves from pricing (noted as future phase)
- Tanya considers remote shutoff "important in the scope of the project"
- She wants to know what valves would add to the total cost
- This signals she may want valves included from the start, or at least costed

### Action Required
- Reply addressing both questions
- Clarify the pilot software approach (fully functional platform, not a demo)
- Provide motorised ball valve pricing or estimate
- Keep Garth and Bradley CC'd (they're on the thread)
