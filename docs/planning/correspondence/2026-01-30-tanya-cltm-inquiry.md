Dear Tanya,

Following our site visit, I am looking into the integration requirements for your tenant management system, noted as "CLTM."

To determine the best way to sync water monitoring data with your billing workflow, could you please provide the full product name and the vendor's details? I will need to contact the provider to inquire about APIs and technical documentation.

If the proposal is accepted and the pilot phase is authorized, I will need to work closely with your CLTM service provider. To help architect the solution, I will eventually require the following information:

1. Full product name and version
2. Software vendor/provider name
3. Vendor's website
4. Your system login URL
5. Confirmation of API availability for programmatic data exchange
6. Technical documentation or developer resources
7. Your account manager or support contact at the vendor
8. The current process for capturing utility billing data (e.g., manual entry or spreadsheet import)

This information will allow me to design an integration that pushes water usage and billing data directly into your existing system.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,

Jason van Wyk
