## Summary

Garth called to update on developments with Tanya regarding meter pricing and supplier selection.

## Key Points

1. **Garth has sent Tanya pricing** for the meters.
2. **Tanya requested better pricing** — citing the volume (588 meters) as justification for a discount.
3. **Garth will revise pricing** — he'll sit with his manager to review and come back with revised numbers.
4. **Tanya is shopping around** — she told Garth she's looking at other meter suppliers.
5. **Garth raised a concern** — if Tanya chose a different meter supplier but still used Jason's monitoring platform, that would undermine the Precision Meters relationship.
6. **Jason's commitment to Garth:**
   - Precision Meters were the only company to give Jason a chance in this space.
   - Jason has strategically partnered his platform with Precision Meters.
   - Jason will not work with other meter suppliers on this project, because of his commitment to Precision Meters.
   - Jason will communicate this position to Tanya directly.

## Implications

- The proposal must clearly state that the platform is designed for and partnered with Precision Meters.
- If Tanya selects a different meter supplier, Precept's platform offering would not apply.
- Meter pricing may come down — Garth revising with his manager.
- Final meter pricing TBC before proposal can be finalised.
