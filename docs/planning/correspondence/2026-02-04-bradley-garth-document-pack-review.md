Hi Garth & Bradley,

As discussed on the phone earlier, please find attached the document pack I'd like to send to Tanya at Mosaic Group. I'd appreciate if you could review and confirm you're comfortable with the content before I forward it to her.

The pack consists of three documents:

1. **Site Assessment Report** (updated) — Building profile, water infrastructure, meter requirements, and solution architecture. You received the original version on 30 January — this has been updated to reflect the confirmed meter specs, 4-gateway design, and external node architecture.

2. **Business Case** — Investment analysis for the City Life project. Covers the financial case (three-pillar ROI: fair billing, conservation, leak detection), phased investment breakdown, 5-year projections, and alternatives comparison. Precision Meters is positioned as the strategic meter supply partner throughout.

3. **Communications Technology Validation** — Technical justification for the private LoRaWAN network. Covers RF propagation analysis for the building, technology comparison (LoRaWAN vs WiFi vs wired vs public IoT), battery life modelling, and 10-year total cost of ownership.

The intention is for Tanya to review these and confirm she wants to proceed. If she's on board, I'll follow up with a formal Scope of Work and Proposal with detailed pricing and timeline.

A few things to note:
- Meter pricing in the business case uses the current figures (R2,100 / R9,360 ex VAT). I understand you're revising pricing with your manager — happy to update if the numbers change before this goes to Tanya.
- The documents reference Precision Meters as a strategic supply partner. Meters are invoiced directly from Precision to Mosaic Group as agreed.
- Node and platform pricing is from Precept separately.

Let me know if anything needs adjusting. I'd like to get this to Tanya by tomorrow if possible.

Kind regards,
